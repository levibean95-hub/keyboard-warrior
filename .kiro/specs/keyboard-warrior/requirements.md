# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Keyboard Warrior is a web application designed to help users craft compelling responses during arguments or debates. The application leverages AI to generate strategic responses based on context, tone preferences, and the user's communication style. The primary goal is to help users articulate their points more effectively, regardless of the objective merit of their position.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user engaged in an argument, I want to input details about my disagreement so that the AI can understand the context and generate relevant responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the argument input interface THEN the system SHALL provide a text area for describing the argument context
2. WHEN a user submits argument details THEN the system SHALL validate that the input is not empty
3. WHEN argument context exceeds reasonable length limits THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback to the user
4. WHEN argument context is successfully submitted THEN the system SHALL store it for response generation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user wanting personalized responses, I want to select different AI personality tones so that the generated responses match my preferred communication style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the tone selection interface THEN the system SHALL display options including "calm and collected", "aggressive", "cunning", "girly", and other personality types
2. WHEN a user selects a tone THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected option clearly
3. WHEN no tone is selected THEN the system SHALL use a default neutral tone
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL apply the selected tone to the AI's output style

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who wants responses that sound like me, I want to upload examples of my own messages so that the AI can emulate my communication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the message upload feature THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to input example messages
2. WHEN a user uploads message examples THEN the system SHALL accept text input or file uploads
3. WHEN message examples are provided THEN the system SHALL analyze the user's communication patterns
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL incorporate the user's communication style into the output
5. IF no message examples are provided THEN the system SHALL generate responses using only the selected tone

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user seeking authentic-sounding responses, I want the AI to avoid typical AI language patterns so that my responses sound natural and human.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates responses THEN the system SHALL avoid common AI writing patterns like excessive em dashes
2. WHEN the AI generates responses THEN the system SHALL use natural, conversational language
3. WHEN the AI generates responses THEN the system SHALL vary sentence structure and avoid formulaic patterns
4. WHEN the AI generates responses THEN the system SHALL match human communication styles rather than formal AI responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user in an active argument, I want to receive multiple response options so that I can choose the most appropriate one for my situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests responses THEN the system SHALL generate multiple response options
2. WHEN displaying response options THEN the system SHALL present them in an easily readable format
3. WHEN a user selects a response THEN the system SHALL provide options to copy or modify the text
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL ensure each option has a distinct approach or angle

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple arguments, I want to save and organize my argument contexts so that I can return to them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an argument context THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save it
2. WHEN a user saves an argument THEN the system SHALL allow them to provide a title or label
3. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL display their saved arguments
4. WHEN a user selects a saved argument THEN the system SHALL load the context and previous settings
5. WHEN a user wants to delete saved arguments THEN the system SHALL provide a clear deletion option

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want my argument data to be handled securely so that my personal disputes remain confidential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits argument data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security measures
3. WHEN a user deletes their data THEN the system SHALL permanently remove it from storage
4. WHEN handling user sessions THEN the system SHALL implement secure authentication if user accounts are required
