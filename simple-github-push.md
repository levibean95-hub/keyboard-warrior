# Simple GitHub Push Instructions

## Option 1: If you already have a GitHub account and want to do it manually

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `keyboard-warrior`
   - Description: "Keyboard Warrior - AI-powered argument assistance web application"
   - Public repository
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push your code (run these commands):**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/keyboard-warrior.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   If it asks for credentials, use:
   - Username: your GitHub username
   - Password: a Personal Access Token (not your password)
     - Get one here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
